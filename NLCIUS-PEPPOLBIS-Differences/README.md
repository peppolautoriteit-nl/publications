# Analysis of the differences between NLCIUS/SI-UBL 2.0 and PEPPOL BIS 3 invoices

The two most widely used document formats for e-invoicing in the Netherlands are SI-UBL 2.0, which implements the business rules of the NLCIUS, and Peppol BIS 3.0 Invoice, which implements business rules specified by PEPPOL.

The [NLCIUS](https://stpe.semantic-treehouse.nl/#/Message_32_model/MessageModel_9c4ec625-b417-4914-868f-64b9f3b1ba24) was defined by the [STPE](https://stpe.nl), and is mainly used for the exchange of invoices between parties in the Netherlands. [PEPPOL BIS 3](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/) is meant for use across Europe, and supporting it is mandatory for all participants on the Peppol network that process e-invoices.

Both models are a Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) of the European Norm 16931. Because of that, there are many similarities between the two. However, there are also a number of differences, especially in the smaller details.

To get a clear picture of how much these specifications diverge, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations has commissioned a detailed analysis of the differences between these two formats.

[This report](NLCIUS-PeppolBIS-Differences-1.1.pdf) is the result of that analysis.
